Getting Started
----------------
What you probably want as a user of Halide is one of our [binary releases](http://github.com/halide/Halide/downloads).

Once you have that, check out the [Getting Started tutorial](https://github.com/halide/Halide/wiki/Getting-Started). Using Halide just requires including a single header and linking against a self-contained static library which includes our entire compiler. Given that, you can JIT or statically compile Halide programs without needing anything else.

Building the Halide compiler from source currently requires some occasionally hairy external dependencies. We're working on streamlining the process for major platforms (Mac & Ubuntu now, Windows to follow) as we speak. But again, you can do anything short of modify the compiler with a [binary release](http://github.com/halide/Halide/downloads).
