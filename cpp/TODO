Track number of dimensions on Buffers and ImageParams in front end in
order to check references and to insert the right number of implicit
args, and to build reduction domains of the correct size

Check that reductions over image parameters where the code doesn't
actually use the parameter correctly pull in the image parameter in
order to use its dimensions

More generally: when visiting variables, it might be necessary to
visit the bounds of the reduction domain

.splitmin will be hidden in the case of repeated splits on the same
name. Should be replaced with prefixing.

Add front-end version of Internal::Argument (call it Arg)

Consider bounds written to in update step of reduction

Out-of-bounds read and write checks on image parameters
